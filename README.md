# Other

you can use `dot(graphbiz)`. 

Doxygen file sample is below.

```ini
# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# The DOT_PATH tag can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be
# found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found in the path.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

DOT_PATH               = /usr/bin/dot
```
